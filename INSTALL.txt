Installation and compilation instructions are straightforward: download the project and run with 64 bit release (for 32 bit please add corresponding .lib files) configuration in Visual Studio 2013 or later. CGAL and BOOST are required for successful compilation of the library.
The code is only tested in Windows but  it should also be possible to extend to Linux and Max OS with a reasonable amount of work.
